# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Overview:
- The purpose of this analysis is to take Citi Bike data and create visualizations that can explain who uses the bike and the time/place this journey begins and ends.

## Visualization
As part of Tableau's feature, we are able to create a dashboard with interative diagrams and descriptions. A preview of my analysis is shown below and can be accessed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nvuono625/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16430745543650/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes)

## Summary
Although there descriptions on each slide in the dashboard, after analyzing the data, the most dense time of use occured by male subscribers on Thursday, between 5PM-6PM. Across all times, the most common user was a subscriber and male. Regardless of gender, the popular times were commuting hours during the week (Monday-Friday, 7AM-9AM; 5PM-7PM) and on the weekend usage was up throughout daylight hours (9AM-8PM).
